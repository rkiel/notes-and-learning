# Box Model

- (Box Model)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model]

Every element has:

- margin - external to the element
- border
- padding - internal to the element
- content - the element

## Margin Collapsing

- (Mastering Margin Collapsing)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing]
- The top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins (or just one of them, if they are equal), a behavior known as margin collapsing.
  - Adjacent siblings
  - No content separating parent and descendants
  - Empty blocks
